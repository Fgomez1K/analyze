This sample is "complete" except:
  - You must add the (CA) certificate for the server you are connecting to your [Java cacerts store](/documentation/rest-api/making-a-request.md#making-a-request-to-a-server-with-https).
  - You must opt-in to use experimental APIs by setting [`OPT_IN_TO_EXPERIMENTAL_API = "SEARCH_V1"`](/documentation/rest-api/search-text.md) in ExampleApp.java
  - See the walkthrough for further details on those steps
